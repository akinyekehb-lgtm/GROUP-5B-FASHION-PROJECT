            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Pentecraft Fashion Hub was founded with a clear vision — to train,
                mentor, and empower aspiring fashion designers with practical skills
                and strong creative confidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe fashion is more than clothing. It is expression, identity,
                and craftsmanship. That is why our training focuses on hands-on learning,
                discipline, creativity, and real-world industry standards.
